During my degree in Environmental Science at UBC, I was always fascinated with the power data has to influence decisions; using R in geohydrology to analyze water catchments, and FishStat to analyze fishery statistics where just a few of my early experiences. Where theory stopped, data took over and communicated powerful concepts with few words. Creating a climate model made me begin to understand how data can be used, but it wasnâ€™t until my data science program at Lighthouse Labs that I realized its full power. During this program, I shifted my focus to ensemble machine learning and deep learning. With my career, I am excited to create and deploy models that theory can explain, but not solve.
