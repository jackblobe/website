I am a former undergrad at UBC, with a degree in Environmental Science focusing on ocean water, air water, and terrestrial water. In my degree, I realized the power of data conscious companies, both as consultants and indivduals. In an effort to lead the way in data conscious decision making as a consultant, I have decided to complete the data science diploma with lighthouse labs and expand how I understand the power data has.
