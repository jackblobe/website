I want to write about what I care about. This means curating my strong convictions, to-be-tested beliefs, pet projects and deep rabbit holes. 

Right now, the topics that interest me deeply relate to business, society, leadership and data science.

## Environment
This was my first calling. Environmental science drove me to ask the important questions, and dive deeper into subjects of geohydrology, pest management, and ocean chemistry. Whenever a new subject appeared, I found the details amazing. What the earth is capable of through evolution continues to amaze me. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Hydrogeology
- Environmental Impact Assesments
- Vegitation Surveys
- Pest Management
- Climatology
- Data literate organizations


## Society
I believe business and society are closely linked. Without an emphasis on important needs within society, the human environment will never be comfortable. As we increase equality among people, especially through the leveraging of large data, we will be able to increase the quality of society, and with it, the environment. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Food and Water security
- Environmental sustainability
- Agriculture and food systems
- Social policy


## Data Science
I was trained in environmental science and data analysis using R, but found my skills lacking. We know that data science concepts and tools have applications in the "big data" regime, uncovering patterns in vast amounts of data that you and I and our laptops cannot possible store or process. What I have come to understand through pursing a diploma in Data Science with Lighthouse Labs is that data science may be the most immediately applicable and accessible for business hoping to leverage environmental processes, including mining companies, oceanographers, and renewable energy companies. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Discriminatory bias perpetuated by AI / ML algorithms
- Purpose-driven data visualization
- AI / ML for non-tech native companies
- AI / ML explainability
- Data science workflows as a part of environmental consulting
- Data literacy as a part of environmental consulting
