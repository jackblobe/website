I recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Envrionmental Science at the University of British Columbia with a focus on terrestrial water, ocean water and air. Pivoting to a focus on data science through R in my last two years of my degree allowed me to peak into the world of data and the insights it provides in important hydrogeologic functions, weather conditions and ocean circulation. This culminated in my final year to making an 80 year climate model using Python for the Pacific Northwest when studying vegitation pattern changes within Burns Bog. In my most recent adventure, I am obtaining a diploma from Lighthouse Labs in Data Science, and developing my love for data science, and in particular the power machine learning and deep learning has to improve our understanding of earth systems.

#### I also consider myself to be:


**Obsessive**: My fascination with data science in part stems from the power it has to influence decisions, and through perusing this tirelessly, I’ve been able to peek into what makes a good and bad data scientist; My time at UBC, Lighthouse, and in my free time has allowed me to dive into how data can leverage better decisions everywhere. Obsessing over data science the way I have started to has allowed me to begin to peek into what I hope to do in my career as a data scientist, a leader and a person.</p>

**A foodie**: Isn’t everyone? Beyond looking forward to cooking a perfect pizza in my Ooni, I see food as a way to connect everyone. Sharing food was never a part of my family, but as I become part of a new family in Vancouver, one I make for myself, I realize the power it has to enact social change, on a micro scale in my case, or a macro scale as is the case to many farming communities around the world. Studying fisheries and looking at farming techniques has allowed me to understand the power food has to contribute to economies and social understanding and I hope data science will allow me to further delve into this topic.</p>

**A leader**: Whether it be at space camp in grade 5 when I was appointed Commander of the flight simulator, or as an integral member and leader of a team to predict the flight delays and cancellations using machine learning, I find I always strive for being strong and proactive while also maintaining equanimity to help me team arrive at a useful endpoint. The calm but strong nature of my decisions has become an important component in every part of my life.</p>

**An adventurer**: When I consider adventures, I love the idea of always perusing something new. Whether it be moving from a town half the size of my university and moving to a new country without any fallback or diving head first into travelling to Asia and exploring local farms to study the benefits local farms have on remote communities, I always love the idea of a new challenge. Data science and how I approach each problem is no different.</p>
