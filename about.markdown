During my degree, I worked extensively with R and Matlab to for data visualization, statistics, and an introduction into mapping earth systems patterns and working with medium sized datasets. Python in my final year took this a step further, which culminated with me attending Lighthouse Labs. During my program,I worked extensively with API’s, web scraping, understanding Pandas and Numpy, and finally machine and deep learning. Working with my first big dataset during my midterm project allowed me to fully utilize ensemble machine learning and feature engineering in conjunction with data visualization to create a multinomial classifier for delay type, binomial classifier for delayed or on time, and a predictor for total delay. 
After this, we delved into the world of deep learning, where I created an English to French translator using RNN’s and explored the nuance of mini-batch gradient decent, teacher forcing and the power of TF-IDF vectorizers. 
For my capstone project I partnered with a micro transit start up, Spare Labs Inc, to analyze their ridership within the United States, in particular Dallas and Illinois. Pairing this data with US census data, I made geofences, and clustered “neighborhoods” using DBSCAN. Within these neighborhoods I further explored ride patterns by race. As a way to tie together what I learned, I created a deep spatiotemporal demand forecast using a combination of CNN’s for contextual demand, and LSTM’s for time demand. This demand forecast has been deployed for use, and is a good example of what I hope to do more of in the future.

#### I also consider myself to be:


**Obsessive**: My fascination with data science in part stems from the power it has to influence decisions, and through perusing this tirelessly, I’ve been able to peek into what makes a good and bad data scientist; My time at UBC, Lighthouse, and in my free time has allowed me to dive into how data can leverage better decisions everywhere. Obsessing over data science the way I have started to has allowed me to begin to peek into what I hope to do in my career as a data scientist, a leader and a person.

**A foodie**: Isn’t everyone? Beyond looking forward to cooking a perfect pizza in my Ooni, I see food as a way to connect everyone. Sharing food was never a part of my family, but as I become part of a new family in Vancouver, one I make for myself, I realize the power it has to enact social change, on a micro scale in my case, or a macro scale as is the case to many farming communities around the world. Studying fisheries and looking at farming techniques has allowed me to understand the power food has to contribute to economies and social understanding and I hope data science will allow me to further delve into this topic.

**A leader**: Whether it be at space camp in grade 5 when I was appointed Commander of the flight simulator, or as an integral member and leader of a team to predict the flight delays and cancellations using machine learning, I find I always strive for being strong and proactive while also maintaining equanimity to help me team arrive at a useful endpoint. The calm but strong nature of my decisions has become an important component in every part of my life.

**An adventurer**: When I consider adventures, I love the idea of always perusing something new. Whether it be moving from a town half the size of my university and moving to a new country without any fallback or diving head first into travelling to Asia and exploring local farms to study the benefits local farms have on remote communities, I always love the idea of a new challenge. Data science and how I approach each problem is no different.
