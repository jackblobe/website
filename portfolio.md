Under construction....

## Master of Data Science projects

- **Climate Model** \| [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jackblobe/Climate_Models_ENVR400)
    - Completed as a part of Masters of capstone project on changing vegitation patterns within Burns Bog. 
    - Status: complete


- **Flight Delay Predictor and Classifier** \| [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jackblobe/Lighthouse_Midterm)
    - Completed as a part of my diploma in Lighthouse labs with one teammate. 
    - Status: In progress
    - Next steps: tie in further use of weather and regionality in hopes of improving prediction ability, play with bootstrapping values to increase the ROC-AUC score of the cancellation classifier, and bootstrap/change sampling to be more respresentative of all delay types for delay type classifier.
