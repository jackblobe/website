## Data Science projects

- **Microtransit and its Impact on Communities within the US**\| [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jackblobe/Spare_Ridership)
    - Investigated the impact of microtransit within the US using ridership data from Spare Labs inc. 
    - Created GeoJsons out of census data to fence riders into census block groups
    - visualized data using Kepler, Folium and Seaborn
    - Created a time series forcast, and wait time predictor for riders.
    - Currently constructing deep spatio temporal demand forcast. 

- **Climate Model** \| [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jackblobe/Climate_Models_ENVR400)
    - Completed as a part of Masters of capstone project on changing vegitation patterns within Burns Bog. 
    - Status: Complete


- **Flight Delay Predictor and Classifier** \| [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jackblobe/FlightDelayPrediction)
    - Using randomforest regression predicted delay for flights in Janurary of 2020 within the United states. EDA was can be seen in exploratory analysis notebook.  
    - Status: Complete
    - Given error within the model, tying in time series into delay would be a useful way to reduce error. Futher, given the size of the data set, deep learning with tensor dimensions being grids of the US with given size in km could provide a more accurate prediction given the features created. 
    - Classifier bias reduced through bootstrapping and SMOTE, in the end, as it often does for my projects, bootstrapping created better predictions with less of a bias variance trade off.
